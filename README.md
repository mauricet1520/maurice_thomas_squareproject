## Steps to run the app

https://developer.android.com/studio/run

## What areas of the app did you focus on?

I focus on using Jetpack Compose, Repository Pattern, Corroutines and ViewModels/Publish subscribe pattern

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?

I wanted my code to be flexible and leverage a new up-to-date way of development.  Using Jetpack Compose to eliminate boilerplate code. 

Also wanted a Separation of Concern pattern.

## How long did you spend on this project?

6 hours

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?

Testing jetpack compose and corroutines was a challenging.  I wanted to have a decent amount of coverage but ran into some issues with Mockito, and TestDispatchers

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

Probably the lack of test, and image caching.

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!

Yes, I copied from previous projects.  Only dependecies and Repository class.

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?

I Unfortunately couldn't complete any test.  I'm familiar with Mockito but couldn't get any test to pass.  My main objective was to deliver the project and make my code flexilbe for changes for the future. I believe with more time I could of completed test.
